### What I do

I transform legacy software into efficient, maintainable, and scalable web platforms,
bridging traditional engineering with modern technologies to solve real business problems.

I have led and delivered projects that produced tangible improvements in cost, operational
efficiency, and software quality:

- **Legacy ERP modernization (WinForms to Web)** using .NET Core and Vue.js,
  reducing maintenance costs by ~35% and enabling a modular, scalable architecture.
- **Real-time financial dashboards** (ASP.NET Core APIs + ECharts),
  eliminating over 20 hours per month of manual reporting and improving business visibility.
- **Data automation and analytics** with Python and Power BI,
  optimizing data pipelines and increasing analytical accuracy by ~30%.
